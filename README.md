Spam-filter-deep-learning
=========================

Project objective
-----------------

* Train machine learning algorithm to distinguish between spam and ham text messages that are pre-labelled.   
* Learn NLP, naive bayes and deep learning algorithms/packages in Python in a practical context.   

Dataset 
-------

The data set has dimensions (5572, 2). The first column called "label" takes the values "spam" or "ham" while the second column names "message" simply contains the sms message as a string. There are 5572 such messages.
